### Procedure
#### In real Laboratory
1. Connect the air blower to the linear air-track and adjust the air so that the glider just glides smoothly.
Check the air holes to clear any blockages due to grit or dust.
2. Adjust the air track feet so that the track is level. Use the bubble level to determine if the track is
level.
3. Fix the light gates on retort stands along the track and adjust the heights so that the light gates are
triggered when the gliders pass through them. Connect the gate to the digital timer/data acquisition
system
4. For in-elastic collisions, attach the velcro-pads at the colliding ends of the glider
5. Measure the masses of the of the gliders along with the extra weights and record them
6. Turn on the air blower for sometime before the air-track is ready for use.
7. Set Glider 1 at one end of the track and Glider 2 nearly in the middle of the track between the two
light gates.
8. Launch Glider 1 fairly fast enough by gently pushing it, passing through the first photogate to collide
with the Glider 2 which is at rest. Stop both the gliders immediately after it bounces of the bumper at
the ends of the track
9. Tabulate the time recorded as the gliders pass through the photo gates before and immediately after
the collision.
10. Repeat the experiment with different velocities and masses

#### In Simulation
1. Set the Type of Collision (elastic/non-elastic)
2. Use sliders to set up the mass of the gliders and velocity of the Glider 1.
3. Click the Play button to launch the gliders
